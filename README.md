# Swither

Swither, by definition means to be indecisive, and relationships, by definition, often times revolve around indecisiveness, especially when it comes to deciding where to go. We don't mean relationships in just couple terminology either. All relationships-- mother-daughter, father-son, siblings, friends, etc. That's why we're creating Swither, the web-based application that will help you make your next night-out decision a lot easier. 

Enjoy!
